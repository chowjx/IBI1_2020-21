Question: Plot a boxplot of total case numbers in different countries (excluding World) on 14 March 2020
Answer: From line number 64 to 70 in covid.py file
Results Discussion: 
From the boxplot (excluding outliers), it is shown that the maximum total cases is approximately 317; 
the minimum total cases is approximately 1; the mean is approximately 38; 
the lower quartile is approximately 11; the upper quartile is approximately 160;
the interquartile range is approximately 149. 
The data is positively skewed. 
The outliers were excluded because they are extreme outliers that lie more than 3 times the interquartile range above the upper quartile,
these can affect the mean of the data set so much by skewing the results so that the mean is no longer representative of the data set.
Overall, this boxplot was not a suitable representative of the entire data set.
